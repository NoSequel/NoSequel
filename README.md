# I am NoSQL, a Java Developer, previously known as NV6.
* :white_check_mark: I code in Java and Python
* :white_check_mark: I'm learning [D](https://dlang.org/) and C/C++

# Previous Experience
I have worked for several minecraft servers, including MineLounge, PvPBar, HCNations, and more. 

# What will you find on my GitHub
You will find things mostly focused on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) development, such as my [Menu API](https://github.com/NoSequel/Katakuna).
I'm currently still learning other programming languages, so currently there will only be Java projects on my github.
