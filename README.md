# What will you find on my GitHub
You will find things mostly focused on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) development, such as my [Menu API](https://github.com/NoSequel/Katakuna)
I'm currently still learning other programming languages, so currently there will only be Java projects on my github.
